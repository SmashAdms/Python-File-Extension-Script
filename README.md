# Python-File-Extension-Script
For this project I created a Python script that leveraging the OS and Shutil modules to search for all documents with a specific extension within a directory and moves those files to the current working directory.
I created  a script called copy_slides.py with a function called pptx_copy.
The script finds files in ~/Downloads with the file extension .pptx or .ppt
and then copies these files into the current working directory.
I found this project to be very challenging but also very rewarding as it allows you to quickly pull files with specific extensions quickly into another folder. 
I think I a just scratching the surface with module imports but have a firm understanding of why they are useful to programmers.
